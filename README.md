# spotifyexport
A python project to export Spotify Playlists so that they can be imported in other locations or analyzed further

This project started as an idea if I wanted to migrate my Spotify Playlists to my own home server or if I wanted to move to another subscription service and compare song offerings.  Additional ideas include analyzing tracks for genre breakdowns, artist prevelance, etc.
